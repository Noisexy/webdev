Learning notes

to create a django project we need to use the command 
django-admin startproject nameoftheproject

to create an app within the django project we need to run the command
python manage.py startapp nameoftheapp 

to run a server we need to run the command 
python manage.py runserver


FOR THE DJANGO'S DATABASE
//we create a model like this in the models.py file in our app 
class Feature (models.Model):
    //data 
then we need to run these commands
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

this will add our model to the database 

to see this reflected we need to go to the django admin panel 
need to make a superuser with
python manage.py createsuperuser

we also need to register our model in the admin.py in our app by 
from .model import "modelName"
admin.site.register(modelName)
